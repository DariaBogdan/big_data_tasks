Task 1

1. Prepare table
Drop database (maybe it existed before).
Create database.
Drop table (maybe it existed before).
Create table 'weather' using file 'better-format-header.txt'.
According to files part-000*,
stationid should be varchar format, 
date -- date format,
other fields -- int.

2. To HDFS
Create directory in HDFS to put files in.
Put in it files part-000*

3. Export
Using 'sqoop export' put files from HDFS to MySQL table, created in the first step.
This step runs MR-job. It takes several minutes.
I changed amount of mappers using -m option, but execution time didn't changed with large amount of mappers,
and increased with 1 mapper, so I decided to use default amount of mappers.

4. Run sql-queries:
SELECT count(*) FROM weather;
SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY stationid, date LIMIT 10;
